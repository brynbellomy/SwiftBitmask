README coming soon.

# install

Make sure you have the latest pre-release version of [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) (`gem install cocoapods --pre`), which has Swift support.  At the time of this writing, that would be `0.36.0.beta.1`.

Add to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Regex'
```

And then from the shell:

```sh
$ pod install
```
